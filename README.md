# PipBoy
This is a basic recreation of the PipBoy 3000 Mark IV from the game Fallout 4 which was developed 
by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks.

The project was written in the Processing IDE as my Year 2 Semester 1 assignment for the Object 
Oriented Programming module while studying Computer Science (Hons) at the Dublin Institute of 
Technology.

Course Code: DT228/2, Student Number: C15332036.

The assignment was to use Processing to create a sci-fi User-Interface using the skills we 
learned during the semester and preferably skills we learned in our own time, the UI should 
contain plenty of animation and be able to be interacted with.

Requires the Sound library by the Processing Foundation which can be downloaded in Sketch-> 
Import Library... -> Add Library... Filter by sound and download the Sound library by The 
Processing Foundation.

I am most proud of my implementation of Polymorphism, altough it was implemented late in 
development i believe it was done rather well and was ultimately good for the overall 
program. I am also proud of my use of animation and music in the program, the zoom 
functionality of the map and the Geiger counter to the right of the screen.
