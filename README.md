# PipBoy
This is a basic recreation of the PipBoy 3000 Mark IV from the game Fallout 4 which was developed 
by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks.

The project was written in the Processing IDE as my Year 2 Semester 1 assignment for the Object 
Oriented Programming module in the Dublin Institute of Technology.
